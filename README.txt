Shipping Containers Analysis with PowerBI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This PowerBI project provides analysis and visualization of a shipping containers dataset, offering insights into container counts, distribution of containers across ports of discharge (PODs) according to vessel names, arrival dates, Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU), and container weights.
p.s. the data used is hypothetical and generated by the contributor himself using formulas in excel sheet (shipdataset_Export).
Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following fields:

Vessel Name: Names of the vessels transporting containers.
Date of Arrival: Arrival dates of vessels at ports.
POD (Port of Discharge): Destination ports where containers are discharged.
Container Counts: Number of containers on each vessel.
TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit): Measurement unit representing the capacity of a container ship.
Weight: Weight of containers transported.

Analysis and Visualization
Features
Selection by Date and Ship: Users can select a specific date and vessel name to view the analysis for that particular timeframe and ship.

Visualization of Container Counts by POD: Visual representations (graphs, charts) showcase the distribution of containers across different PODs based on vessel names.

Arrival Date Trends: Analysis of trends over time, highlighting peaks and lows of container arrivals.

TEU and Weight Analysis: Comparative analysis of TEU and container weight across vessels and dates.
